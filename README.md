chatbot answering vitamins of different fruits

## Description of my ChatBot :

   - Name of my ChatBot is  _**JACOB.**_
     
   - It is designed to print the vitamins of different fruits as per the user input.
   
   - Along with the vitamins it also prints in which countries the fruits production rate is high.
  
## How it works :

   - Firstly the chatbot introduces itself as Jacob, and asks for user name.
   
   - Then waits for user input, after the user input.
   
   - Now it will greet the user according to the time of the day and provides the user with 2 instructions.
   
   - The instructions are : 
      - To get a fruit detail it asks the user to enter a name of fruit.
      
      - Then it display the list of fruits,for user convenience.
      
      - To end chat,it asks the user to enter "0".
      
   - If the user enters a fruit name it will search for the details and provides the user with requires details.
   
   - If the user enters other than a fruit name it gives a warning to enter a valid fruit name.
   
   - If the user enters 0 then it greets and quit the chat.
